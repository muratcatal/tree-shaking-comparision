# Tree-shaking in JavaScript
 
Tree-shaking is a technique to remove unused code blocks in your bundle. 
This sample implements how to configure different bundlers for tree-shaking and compares how different bundlers behave in that process.

## How to run
3 bundlers implemented to compare tree-shaking.

`yarn build:webpack`
`yarn build:rollup`
`yarn build:parcel`

or you can run all.
`yarn build:all`
